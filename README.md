            queue ADT. 

    sq_slow.c : an implementation of the service queue ADT which 
            is behaviorally correct, but does NOT meet the runtime
            requirements.

    driver.c : a simple interactive program which creates a service
            queue instance and lets the user execute operations on 
            the resulting service queue.  

    Makefile : a simple makefile to create sq_slow.o, sw.o, and the executables
            called driver and fdriver. 
            
    list.h and llist.c : implementation of a list ADT used by sq_slow.c
